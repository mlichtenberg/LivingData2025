# LivingData2025

This repository contains the slideshow and notes for my presentation, Persistent Identifier Exchange Between BHL and Wikidata, given at the Living Data 2025 conference in Bogot√°, Colombia.  This material is located in the Presentation folder.

In addition, the Code folder contains sample code in Python, R, Javascript, C#, SPARQL, and others.  These samples demonstrate how to programmatically use SPARQL to extract persistent identifiers from Wikidata.
